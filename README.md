### Task-05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Internship: Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns related to time of day, weather conditions, and accident severity using data visualization techniques.

---

### Dataset
Source: US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)

Description:
The dataset contains records of traffic accidents across the United States, including information about time, location, weather conditions, and accident severity. Due to the large size of the dataset, a sampled subset was used for analysis.

---

### Data Preparation
- Loaded a sampled portion of the dataset for efficient processing.
- Selected relevant columns related to time, weather, and severity.
- Converted time information into a usable datetime format.
- Extracted hour information for time-based analysis.

---

### Analysis and Visualizations
The following analyses were performed:
- Accidents by hour of day to identify peak accident times.
- Top weather conditions during accidents to understand environmental factors.
- Distribution of accident severity levels.
- Top state accidents. 

---

### Observations
- Accident frequency is higher during peak daytime hours.
- Most accidents occur under common weather conditions.
- Severity levels show variation across accident records.

---

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates how traffic accident data can be analyzed to identify important patterns related to time and weather conditions. Such insights can help in understanding factors contributing to road accidents.
